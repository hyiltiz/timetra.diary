`Timetra Diary` is a CLI time tracker application with a YAML backend.

It also has a simple *curses* frontend and used to have a *web* one (which
proved useless compared to CLI).

Initially `Timetra Diary` technically was a set of Hamster_ frontends.
Now the backends are pluggable (the Hamster one was dropped completely).
